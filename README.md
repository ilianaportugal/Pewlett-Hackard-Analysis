# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze employee information to determine the number of employees retiring and identify employees eligible to launch a mentorship program.

## Results
- The role of Senior Engineer (29,414) and Senior Staff (28,254) make up more than half the titles for employees who will be retiring soon. The hiring team should focus on finding new or existing talent for these roles.

- There are 1,549 current employees who would be eligible to participate in the mentorship program as mentors.
- Most eligible employees for this program hold the title Senior Staff (420) or Engineer (388).

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? Based on a count of employee numbers from the retirement_info table 41,380 employees will soon retire. The company should think about how this will impact them and how to fill these roles. 
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? In total, there are 1,549 eligible employees for the mentorship program. There are not available mentors for every department and/or title. Most available mentors hold the title Senior Staff (420) or Engineer (388).
